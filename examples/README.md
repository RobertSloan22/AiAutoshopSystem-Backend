- Full report (markdown or structured sections)
- Research approach (search plan)

```jsx
import ResearchReportViewer from './components/ResearchReportViewer';

function MyComponent() {
  return <ResearchReportViewer researchId="64f3a1b2c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4" />;
}
```

### 2. ResearchReportList

A component that displays a grid of research reports with pagination and search functionality.

#### Usage:

## API Endpoints

These components work with the following API endpoints:

1. `GET /api/research-results/:id` - Get a single research report by ID
2. `GET /api/research-results` - Get a list of research reports with pagination and filtering

## Styling
